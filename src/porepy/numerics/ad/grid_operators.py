    Parameters:
        subdomains: List of grids representing subdomains.
        dim: Dimension of the quantities to be projected. 1 corresponds to scalars, 2 to
            a vector of two components etc.

            projection matrices for face-based quantities as items.

    The global face numbering is set according to the order of the input subdomains.
